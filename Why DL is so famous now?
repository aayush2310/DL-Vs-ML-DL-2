Why famous?
-->Datasets:-DL is data hungry.Around 2015,two revolutions came-(i)smartphone revolution (ii)Internet pricing revolution.On daily basis huge amount of data got generated.
             Now,big companies converted the unlabelled data to the labelled data.They converted the dataset to public dataset,can be accessed by anyone.
             eg:-Microsoft COCO is a dataset of images.
                 Youtube 8M dataset contains videos
                 SQUAD-dataset of texts from wikipedia
                 GOOGLE AUDIOSET-dataset of audios from google
                 
-->Frameworks/Libraries=>Tensorflow by google,Pytorch by facebook
-->Architecture of the models:-ANN(node and edges(weights))A different nural networks have less nodes and different edges connection.In ANN,there the node is called 
                               perceptron.Different neural networks architecture can be created.Researchers have already made some neural networks and trained as well,we
                               download the architecture and use it.This is called transfer learning.
-->hardware:-Matrix operation->GPU required
-->community

Pytorch to tensorflow conversion:-drop down gui based application for conversion.
image classification-->RESNET neural network
Text Classification-->BERT neural network
Image segmentation-->UNETV nn
