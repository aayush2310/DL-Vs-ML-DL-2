1)Data Dependency:-DL requires more data than ML.At less data ML is better and at high data DL is better.

2)Hardware Dependency:-ML models can be trained on our computer on the CPU but in DL heavy matrix multiplication goes on which requires GPU,run slow on CPU.

3)Training Time:-DL models are complex,so model training time is high.Prediction time is fast in DL,whereas in some ML model like KNN,prediction time is slow.

4)Feature Selection:-DL algos automatically extract relevent features from the data,whereas in ML model we need to manually extract those features.

5)Interpretability:-It is very low in case of DL and high in case of ML.eg:-If i want to make a DL model so that it bans people based on the comments made by them,then 
DL model will ban or not ban on the basis of its criteria but it will not tell the reason why the person was banned,but it is not so in ML.
eg:-in case of decision tree algo in ML,we can explain why a point was called 1 and other 0 based on the basis of branching.
Due to this reason in some cases ML is better than DL.
