DL is a subfield of AI and ML that is inpired by the structure of a human brain.
DL algorithms attempt to draw similar conclusions as humans would by continually analyzing data with a given logical structue called Neural Networks.
ML algorithms focus on statistical techniques to get the relation between input and output whereas DL depends upon a logical structure called neural network.
Artificial neural netwrk is the most fundamental neural network whose most fundamental unit is perceptron(the nodes) which are connected by the arrows called weights.
The perceptron present in a single line are called layers.
The layer where we get i/p is called i/p layer and the other is called o/p layer.Rest are called hidden layers.Deep learning name comes from the hidden layer,if the 
number of hidden layers are much,then the whole networks become deep.

ANN,CNN,RNN,GAN

why so famous?
1)Applicable in many fields
2)Performance

DL is a part of a broader family of ML methods based on artificial neural networks with representative learning.
DL algorithms uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from raw input.For eg:-in image processing,lower layers may identify edges,while higher layers
may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.
